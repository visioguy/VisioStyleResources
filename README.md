# VisioStyleResources
Visio Style Resources was created to assist in projects that mimic or expand on Visio's user-interface. When creating custom forms, it is sometimes necessary to re-create visuals, such as arrowheads, fill patterns, line patterns, and other stylistic entities.

It is the goal of this repository to provide icons and images that will make this less of a chore for Visio add-in developers.


Currently, VisioStyleResources has icons for:

- Visio's built-in arrowhead styles, in 32x23, 64x64, and 128x128 sets
