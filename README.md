# VisioStyleResources
Visio Style Resources was created to assist in projects that mimic or expand on Visio's user-interface. When creating custom forms, it is sometimes necessary to re-create visuals, such as arrowheads, fill patterns, line patterns, and other stylistic entities.

It is the goal of this repository to provide icons and images that will make this less of a chore for Visio add-in developers.


Currently, VisioStyleResources has icons for:

- Visio's built-in arrowhead styles, in 32x23, 64x64, and 128x128 sets. This includes icons for 46 arrowhead styles (indices 0-45), plus a complete "filmstrip" image (_allIcons_xx.png) that can be frame-shifted in place of 46 separate images.

In the future:
- Visio line patterns
- Visio fill patterns?
